# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished my markdown previewer project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certificate!

**Thoughts:** Working through the Modern React with Redux course this morning really helped me out with this one. Also, it taught me a bunch of ES6! Tomorrow I'll convert my CSS to SASS, upload the project to my website and make a start on the camper leaderboard project.

### Day 2: 4 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of SASS and added it to my Markdown Previewer Project.

**Thoughts:** SASS is pretty cool. Can't wait to use it on a bigger project. Tried to  work out how to deploy my app on to my website but gave up for today.

### Day 3: 5 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Deployed Markdown Previewer App but styles are missing. Used create-react-app to make boilerplate for my camper-leaderboard project. Organised what components I will need for leaderboard and started coding them.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to import the css file to get styles working for the Markdown Previewer. I think I have got all the components I need for the leaderboard project and am thinking I should be able to finish it tomorrow.
