# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished my markdown previewer project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certificate!

**Thoughts:** Working through the Modern React with Redux course this morning really helped me out with this one. Also, it taught me a bunch of ES6! Tomorrow I'll convert my CSS to SASS, upload the project to my website and make a start on the camper leaderboard project.
