# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished my markdown previewer project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certificate!

**Thoughts:** Working through the Modern React with Redux course this morning really helped me out with this one. Also, it taught me a bunch of ES6! Tomorrow I'll convert my CSS to SASS, upload the project to my website and make a start on the camper leaderboard project.

### Day 2: 4 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of SASS and added it to my Markdown Previewer Project.

**Thoughts:** SASS is pretty cool. Can't wait to use it on a bigger project. Tried to  work out how to deploy my app on to my website but gave up for today.

### Day 3: 5 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Deployed Markdown Previewer App but styles are missing. Used create-react-app to make boilerplate for my camper-leaderboard project. Organised what components I will need for leaderboard and started coding them.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to import the css file to get styles working for the Markdown Previewer. I think I have got all the components I need for the leaderboard project and am thinking I should be able to finish it tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on Camper Leaderboard App.

**Thoughts:** Need to rethink my Camper Leaderboard and work out why I'm getting the bugs I'm getting.

### Day 5: 8 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did more work on personal portfolio website. Added AJAX contact form from a tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed learning a little bit of php and procrastinating on Camper Leaderboard App. Later today I might do a bit more on it.

**Today's Progress**: Did more work on personal portfolio website. Fixed up all CSS styling issues.

### Day 7: 10 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Tried to get my API call working for the camper leaderboard app.

**Thoughts:** Having trouble getting my head around how to do things in ES6. Tried two different methods of making the call and they both didn't work. Will investigate more tomorrow.

### Day 8: 11 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Got API call working and started working on my point_type_selector's functionality.

**Thoughts:** API call was working, I just wasn't referencing the right key in the JSON object. Oops. Started trying to figure out the best way to pass state around the app and where I should put my getData method.

### Day 9: 12 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked out how to pass state from App.js to my CamperList component and started work on CamperListItem.

**Thoughts:** Felt good about today. Struggled with how to pass state at the start but got the hang of it after reading some stack overflow. Tomorrow, I'll work on generating my camper_list_items using the .map() method and the PointTypeSelector component.

### Day 10: 13 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished CamperListItem component and started doing some basic styling.

**Thoughts:** Another good day. Tomorrow I'll have to stop procrastinating about the PointTypeSelector, finish the styling and update the README.md

### Day 11: 14 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished camper leaderboard project and started on recipie box.

**Thoughts:** Achieved all the stuff I set out to do today. Feeling good. Had some trouble working out how to add the SCSS styles to my page after I deployed it on GitHub Pages. Played around with stuff, broke the whole app, cloned it from my repo, played around some more and now it magically works.

### Day 12: 15 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on App and RecipeList components

**Thoughts:** Didn't get alot done today. Having trouble working out why I sometimes get ```Can only update mounted or mouting component``` error when I use ```.setState``` on methods in my class.

### Day 13: 16 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on RecipeList and RecipeListItem components

**Thoughts:** Tried for 10-20 minutes to work out the error from yesterday but gave up temporarily and started moving forward getting the RecipeListItem component working.

### Day 13: 16 January, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Took a step back and reworked the App and added a new component

**Thoughts:** Gave up on the error for now and decided to focus on making the app fully functional first then I'll worry about local storage and state management when it's all up and running. For some reason my return statement on the IngredientList component isn't being called so the <li> JSX element isn't displaying.
